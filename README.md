# Chess Application - Agile Team Development

[application on Heroku](https://pawnstars-firehose.herokuapp.com/)

This chess application was built as part of the Firehose Project. Under the guidance of a senior software engineer, we had weekly Agile team meetings for code reviews, sprint planning, and feature assignments. Users are able to create accounts and play games against each other.

The following technologies were used to create this application.

* Ruby on Rails
* Bootstrap framework
* PostgreSQL database
* Heroku hosting
* RSpec testing driven development
* AJAX requests
* jQuery for drag and drop functionality

## Test the application

You can download or clone the files to run this application locally. You will need to know how to navigate the Rails framework as the functionality is spread across the files in the Controller, Models and Views folders.
